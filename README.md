# home-performance-publish

A small project to learn [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) and automate some of my quarterly home performance data publishing tasks.

Uses AngularJS and [electangular.js](https://github.com/develephant/electangular) and a few other npm modules for saving json settings and files.

Currently learning how to write test using [Spectron](https://github.com/electron/spectron) and [MochaJS](https://mochajs.org).
